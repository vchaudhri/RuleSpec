# RuleSpec
Rule Specification Language

8/20/2018
Completed a basic version of the parser that 
 - handles formulas (ie, translates them to Epilog)
 - generates a rudimentary user interface (emits a worksheet 
   that accepts necessary values, and prints the answers)

To test the code, Simply run ParseRuleSpec.Py. This will produce
RuleSpec\translator\worksheet.html and also print the output on 
console
